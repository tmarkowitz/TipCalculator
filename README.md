## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Added function to add party size to calculate the total per person

## Notes

I had some difficulty setting up xcode as the mac I was using did not have the right OS installed. I also ran into an issue where after adding an additional feature, clicking on a text entry box would crash my application. I had to debug and figured out that my outlets were not mapped correctly in the document outline.
